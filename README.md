# quagzws-sidef
This repository stores the [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/) definition file for the `quagzws` container image. The defintion file is called `Singularity`. This repository is linked to a collection on `Singularity Hub` ([SHUB](https://singularity-hub.org/)). Whenever the definition file is changed and pushed to this Github repository, a new build on `SHUB` can be triggered. So far, we have set the builds to be triggered manually. Becuase on a free account only a limited number of builds per day are available. 

Problems, tests and other open points are submitted as issues to the project [Neuinstallation ZWS-Server](https://github.com/pvrqualitasag/quagzws-sidef/projects).
