## Background


## Docker as Pre-Requisites
Docker on MacOs runs as hypervisor and can be downloaded from https://www.docker.com/get-started. An ubuntu container image can be run using

```
docker run ubuntu
```

When running the above command for the first time, an image of an ubuntu docker container is pulled from docker-hub and the container is run. The list of available docker containers is obtained by

```
docker ps -a
```

Starting a shell in that container can be done using

```
docker exec -it 9d8a4cd06026 bash
```

The above command opens a root-shell into an ubuntu container.

The only software program that is used in the ubuntu docker container is the singularity-host-container.
