```

## Requirements and Problems
From the documenatation given in the user [guide]https://tsp-repo.thesnppit.net/resources/TheSNPpit-user-guide-latest.pdf), it is clear that TheSNPpit as it comes out of the box is a program that is targetted towards running on a single machine. This means that there is one instance of the database-server and one installation of the client programs that accesses the data in the database. Different users on the same machine can use the client programs which can all interact with the given instance of the database on the same machine.

```{r base-installation-thesnppit, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/base-installation-thesnppit.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/base-installation-thesnppit.png")
```


It gets more complicated if we want to be able work with the same data from different machines. This requires to get access to the database-server from different clients running on different machines. This requires a distributed setup over different machines. 

```{r distributed-installation-thesnppit, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/distributed-installation-thesnppit.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/distributed-installation-thesnppit.png")
```


A further requirement for using the provided installation infrastructure is that root access is available on the machine where TheSNPPit is to be installed. 

As a consequence of the points described above, the automatic installation script given in the tarball from TheSNPpit cannot be used. 


## Strategy
The problems described in the previous section are to be solved in different steps. 

1. Installation of TheSNPpit on a single ZWS-machine given the restrictions of not having root access to the machine and only having a single user `zws`. The single machine installation requires to do all steps given in the installation section of the user guide separately. 
2. Try to expand the clients to be able to be used on different machines. The distributed usage of TheSNPpit includes the installation of the database server on one machine and the client part of the package on all machines where TheSNPpit should be used. All the clients must be able to connect to the single instance of the database server. Alternatively it would also be possible to setup a master-slave replication scheme between the machines where one machine has the database master and all the others run replication slave databases. But so far, this seams to be too complicated compared to the benefits that would result from this setup. 


## Installation Resources
### User Guide
We are currently checking the user guide on https://tsp-repo.thesnppit.net/resources/TheSNPpit-user-guide-latest.pdf for hints on how to install. Chapter 6 of the user guide describes the installation. The proposed way to install TheSNPpit is to download the tar-ball from the website, to unpack the tarball and to run the script `bin/install`. Since this requires root priviledges, this cannot be used in a singularity container.

### Manual Installation
In section 6.3 of the user guide, a manual installation is described. In Listing 57, the software required by TheSNPpit is described. The installation procedure given there is based on system-wide installations. 


## Experiments
This section describes the trials and experiments with a local installation. The experiments consist of the four steps given in section 6.3 of the user guide.

### System software installation
In a first experiment, the system software is added to the list of software that is installed in the singularity container. The following statement checks whether the required system software is already in the singularity definition file.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cd /home/quagadmin/simg/img/ubuntu1804lts
for p in perl gcc PostgreSQL PostgreSQL-contrib libecpg6 libecpg-dev libdbi-perl libinline-perl libmodern-perl-perl libcloog-ppl1 libcloog-ppl0 libfile-slurp-perl libdbd-pg-perl libjudy-dev
do
  echo " * Checking def for $p ..."
  grep "$p" ../../def/ubuntu1804lts/quagzws_ubuntu1804lts.def
  sleep 2
done
```

All packages that were indicated except for `perl` and `gcc` which are installed in the container by default are added to the container building definition file and a new image is built.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cd /home/quagadmin/simg/img/thesnppit
../../shub/bash/build_simg.sh -d ../../def/thesnppit/quagzws_ubuntu1804lts.def -w /home/quagadmin/simg/img/thesnppit
```

The original aim was to have all system software including the postgres database installed in the singularity container. But with such a database installation, user `zws` cannot start a local database, as is shown below

```
zws@1-htz:~$ /var/lib/postgresql/10/main/bin/initdb -D /qualstorzws01/data_projekte/projekte/thesnppit/data -A trust -U zws
bash: /var/lib/postgresql/10/main/bin/initdb: Permission denied
```

A first attempt to fix this problem is to change the directory permissions using `chmod` for `/var/lib/postgresql/10/main` in the singularity recipe file. This makes the directory visible, but the `bin` directory with the program to init a DB is not included there. According to https://superuser.com/questions/1320145/postgresql-10-does-not-start-under-ubuntu-18-04, the bin-directory is found in `/usr/lib/postgresql/10/bin`. Hence the command to init a DB is

```
/usr/lib/postgresql/10/bin/initdb -D /qualstorzws01/data_projekte/projekte/thesnppit/data -A trust -U zws
The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user "zws".
This user must also own the server process.

The database cluster will be initialized with locale "en_US.UTF-8".
The default database encoding has accordingly been set to "UTF8".
The default text search configuration will be set to "english".

Data page checksums are disabled.

Success. You can now start the database server using:

    /usr/lib/postgresql/10/bin/pg_ctl -D /qualstorzws01/data_projekte/projekte/thesnppit/data -l logfile start
```

This created several configuration files of which the port setting in postgresql.conf was changed.

```
mv /qualstorzws01/data_projekte/projekte/thesnppit/data/postgresql.conf /qualstorzws01/data_projekte/projekte/thesnppit/data/postgresql.conf.org
cat /qualstorzws01/data_projekte/projekte/thesnppit/data/postgresql.conf.org | sed -e "s/\#port = 5432/port = 5434/" > /qualstorzws01/data_projekte/projekte/thesnppit/data/postgresql.conf
```

The database server is then started with

```
LOGDIR=/qualstorzws01/data_projekte/projekte/thesnppit/log
LOGFILE=$LOGDIR/`date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S"`_postgres.log
if [ ! -d "$LOGDIR" ];then mkdir -p $LOGDIR;fi
/usr/lib/postgresql/10/bin/pg_ctl -D /qualstorzws01/data_projekte/projekte/thesnppit/data -l $LOGFILE start
waiting for server to start.... done
server started
```

Try to get a connection using the client

```
/usr/lib/postgresql/10/bin/createuser -h localhost -p 5434 zws # throws an error and hence might not be necessary.
/usr/lib/postgresql/10/bin/createdb -h localhost -p 5434 -O zws zws
/usr/lib/postgresql/10/bin/psql -h localhost -p 5434
```

Stopping the database server

```
/usr/lib/postgresql/10/bin/pg_ctl -D /qualstorzws01/data_projekte/projekte/thesnppit/data stop
```

This concludes the system software installation part of the user guide.


### Database Configuration


## First Experiments with a local PostgreSQL Database

### Local pgsql
In a first attempt, we try to compile our own pgsql database. 


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
mkdir -p /home/zws/postgresql/9.5/main
cd source/postgres
wget https://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/source/v9.5.19/postgresql-9.5.19.tar.gz
tar -xvzf postgresql-9.5.19.tar.gz 
cd postgresql-9.5.19/
./configure --prefix=/home/zws/postgresql/9.5/main
make
make install
```

According to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40644400/create-postgresql-database-without-root-privilege, we try to start a local db-cluster using the following commands.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
./postgresql/9.5/main/bin/initdb -D /home/zws/postgresql/9.5/main/data -A trust -U zws
```

The above resulted in the following output

```
The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user "zws".
This user must also own the server process.

The database cluster will be initialized with locale "en_US.UTF-8".
The default database encoding has accordingly been set to "UTF8".
The default text search configuration will be set to "english".

Data page checksums are disabled.

Success. You can now start the database server using:

    ./postgresql/9.5/main/bin/pg_ctl -D /home/zws/postgresql/9.5/main/data -l logfile start
```

The question about where the configuration is stored is answered by https://serverfault.com/questions/152942/location-of-postgresql-conf-and-pg-hba-conf-on-an-ubuntu-server

The above start command requires an empty `data` directory. The configuration files will all be placed into the data directory. In `postgresql.conf` the port was changed to 5434 to not get in conflict with any other running postgresql instances.

Connecting with the client to the running database required the following steps according to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16973018/createuser-could-not-connect-to-database-postgres-fatal-role-tom-does-not-e/16974197#16974197

where the `createuser` statement threw an error at me, but the database creation worked. Afterwards I was able to connect with the client to the database.


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
./postgresql/9.5/main/bin/createuser -h localhost -p 5434 zws
./postgresql/9.5/main/bin/createdb -h localhost -p 5434 -O zws zws
./postgresql/9.5/main/bin/psql -h localhost -p 5434
```
