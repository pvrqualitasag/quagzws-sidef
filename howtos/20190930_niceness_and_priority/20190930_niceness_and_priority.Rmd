## Disclaimer
Some hints to assign different levels of priority to different jobs running on the same linux machine. The facts shown here are mostly based on https://askubuntu.com/questions/656771/process-niceness-vs-priority. 


## Background
There are different sources about process priorities on a linux system and their relation to niceness and the program `nice`. Examples are 

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_(Unix)
* https://www.howtogeek.com/411979/how-to-set-process-priorities-with-the-nice-and-renice-commands-in-linux/
* https://www.thegeekdiary.com/unix-linux-how-to-change-the-niceness-priority-of-a-process/

In summary, the user can use the program `nice` to assign a niceness value (see Practical Example) when starting a process. One has to be careful when starting different processes in parallel from inside a script, because all the processes started from inside the master-script would be required to start with a given `nice` command. In such a scenario, perhaps the program `renice` is more suited. This lets you re-assign a niceness value to a certain script. 

It is important to remember that when looking at a top-output lower values of priority (`PR`) and nice (`NI`) are associated with a higher priority. The following relation holds between `PR` and `NI`: $PR = 20 + NI$. 

An ordinary user (no sudoer rights) can only assign nice values between $0$ and $19$. The negative values are reserved to admins. From the experience below, ordinary users can only increase but not decrease nice values.


## Practical Example
When starting several processes out of a master script and you wanted to give them a lower nice value this can easily be done using the program `renice`. 

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
./prog/runBayesCPi.sh work/gsRuns.txt.1
```

The above command starts a number of `GenSel` jobs. Using the `top` output, we can see that the `GenSel` jobs are running with some other jobs with all the same `NI` values. 

```{r screenshot-top-no-nice, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/screenshot-top-no-nice.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/screenshot-top-no-nice.png")
```


## Assign Different Priority
In case we want to assign a different `NI` value to all the `GenSel` jobs, we can do this with the following statement. 

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
renice 19 -p $(pgrep GenSel4R)
```

This changes the top-output to the following

```{r screenshot-top-with-nice, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/screenshot-top-with-nice.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/screenshot-top-with-nice.png")
```
 
Decreasing the `NI` values for the processes does not seam to be possible for ordninary users. 

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
renice 0 -p $(pgrep GenSel4R)
```

leads to the output
